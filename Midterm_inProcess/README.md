# CSE3200 

## Quick Note: 
- Here is a completed work. Please grade my **Midterm_NeedGrading**

## Briefly describing the status of my system
- There are 3 fragments: **Home**, **Dashboard**, and **Notification**
- Each fragment has three independent timers. Each timers have three buttons to be controlled over:
    + "Start": Start the timer, either from 0, or where we left off when hitting "Pause"
    + "Stop/Pause": Temporarily pause the timer
    + "Reset": Reset the timer to 0
- All timers survive thoroughout changes: screen changing, phone rotation.
- Additional feature: 
    + In **Home**: I added incremented counter to increment the timer 

Happy coding!
